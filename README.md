# Fluid Simulation with Event Manager (Optimized with OpenMP and CUDA)

This project implements a fluid simulation using Jos Stam's stable fluid solver in 3D, incorporating dynamic events such as adding density sources and applying forces at specified timesteps. The simulation is optimized with OpenMP (parallelism on CPU) and CUDA (parallelism on GPU) to enhance performance, and was developed as the project for the Parallel Computing course at the University of Minho (2024/2025).

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler**: The C++ code relies on the standard C++ library.
- **Python**: The Python script is used to generate event data for the fluid simulation.
- **Python**: The Python script generate_events.py is used to generate event data for the fluid simulation.

OpenMP: Used for parallelism on the CPU.

CUDA: Used for parallelism on the GPU.

Libraries and Tools:

Python

OpenMP libraries (e.g., libomp for compiling with OpenMP)

CUDA libraries (e.g., libcudart for compiling with CUDA)
### Libraries and Tools
- Python
- Standard C++ libraries for compilation (e.g., `g++` or `clang++`).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jgbarbosa/3dfluid.git
    cd 3dfluid
    ```

2. **Compile the C++ Simulation**:
    Use the included `Makefile` to build the C++ simulation.
    ```bash
    make
    ```

    This will generate an executable named `fluid_sim`.

## Usage

### Generating Event Data

The Python script `generate_events.py` generates a file (`events.txt`) that specifies density sources and forces applied during specific timesteps. All events are generated with normalized vectors, and the simulation will apply them at the correct timestep.

1. **Run the Python script**:
    ```bash
    python generate_events.py
    ```

    This will create an `events.txt` file with 1000 timesteps, where sources are density values, and forces are applied in positive directions along the X, Y, or Z axes.

2. **Customize the Event Generation**:
    You can modify the script to generate different events by changing the number of events, the range of timesteps, or the magnitude of forces and densities.

### Running the Fluid Simulation

Once you've generated the `events.txt` file, you can run the fluid simulation, which will read the events and apply them over the course of the simulation.

1. **Run the simulation**:
    ```bash
    ./fluid_sim
    ```

    The simulation will read the `events.txt` file, apply the specified sources and forces at the correct timesteps, and calculate the fluid dynamics.

2. **Simulation Output**:
    At the end of the simulation, the total density in the fluid field will be printed.

    Example output:
    ```
    Total density after 1000 timesteps: 3456.789000
    ```

## Example

### Generating Events

Here’s an example of how you can use the Python script to generate a file of events (`events.txt`):

```bash
python generate_events.py
```

This will generate an event file like the following:

```
1000
source 10 50
force 1 0 0 200
source 5 150
force 0 1 0 400
source 8 900
```

### Problems with the generator
If you are experiencing problems with the generator there is a events.txt file as an example in the root folder of the project.

Use the file and contact the teaching staff to get help.

### Running the Simulation

Once `events.txt` is generated, you can run the fluid simulation using:

```bash
./fluid_sim
```

The simulation will dynamically apply the sources and forces defined in `events.txt`, simulate the fluid behavior, and print the total density after 1000 timesteps.
